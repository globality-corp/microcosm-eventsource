"""
Event type enumerations.

As events are processed, they accumulate a `state` as a list of event types, using
a pluggable rule system:

 -  The state can be the current event: `current()`
 -  The state can be a union of the current event and the current state: `union()`
 -  The state can be another state: `alias()`

State machine transitions are defined using a DNF-compatible mini-language that processes
this accumulated `state` and the current event:

 -  An event can legally follow another another event: `event(name)`
 -  An event can legally follow a disjunction of conditions: `any_of(...)`
 -  An event can legally follow a conjunction of conditions: `all_of(...)`
 -  An event can legally follow a negation of a conditon: `but_not(...)`
